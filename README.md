# Mixin

Mixin for Elixir.
Delegates all functions to ModuleA from moduleB.
Works like a so-called `Mixin`.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `mixin` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mixin, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
